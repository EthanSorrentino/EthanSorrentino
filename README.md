Game is called Grid Block

You control a blue cube in a 3 by 3 grid. 
Your goal is to avoid the red projectile coming towards from any direction, your character is destroyed when you touch the red projectiles.. 
Sometimes yellow spheres can spawn in called Coins which don't harm the player and gives the player bonus points when interacting with them.
After a certain amount of time another red projectile spawns in per round (starts at 1 then ramps to 2 per round after 15 rounds pass). 
The speed of the projectiles also increases after the 15 threshold is met.


How to Play?

Use WASD to move your cube around either Up, Down, Left, or Right.
Your character moves one spot(white sphere) at a time and can't move beyond the white spheres.
